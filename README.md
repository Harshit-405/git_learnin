This is a elctricity bill calculator that i made for my personal use
using this I (renter )keep tracks of my meter's reading and when the bill comes as I calculate hom much unit i have used using this 
and then hence calc how much i owe the owner (landlord)

File structure :
Calc Elec bill.py #main program to run which takes user input
meter_reading.txt #retains the info (values) of last date and the last meter reading recorded on that date
record.txt        #once the bill is calulated it is stored as a log in this file so if req one access their database through this file
